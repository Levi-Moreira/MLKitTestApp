# MLKitTestApp
A sample app to test the capabilities of Firebase [MLKit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml-kit/) in app features.

For now the has one single Activity:

## SmileDetectionActivity
As the name suggests this Activity is responsible for [detecting smiles](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml-kit/android/detect-faces) in a picture.

One can either take a picture right there or select one from the gallery.

The picture must be in the vertical position in order to the detector to work.


More soon :)
